\description{
#' This dataset is a subset of the North American Breeding Bird Survey, containing data collected at 24 routes in Michigan, USA.
Each route has 10 stops, and the dataset includes counts for 20 bird species. It is in the form of an array of dimension (R,T,S,K), which means that it is ready for use with the MNM_fit function and requires no further pre-processing.
