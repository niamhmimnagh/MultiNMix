\description{
This dataset is a subset of the North American Breeding Bird Survey, containing data collected at 24 routes in Michigan, USA.
Each route has 10 stops, and the dataset includes counts for 20 bird species.
}
\details{
This dataset represents a subset of the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Data was collected in Michigan over six years,
with observations for 20 bird species recorded at 24 routes, each surveyed 10 times. The dataset is used
to study avian biodiversity and population trends.
